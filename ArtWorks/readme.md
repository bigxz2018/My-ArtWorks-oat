Here tp explain how these works from.
Hi everyone here a dumby is, I was literally majoy in social science in college but like 
natural science more. It seems to relate to one of my hobbies: art, but I'm honestly not an artist at all without systematic training or studying. The first time I was learning about the programing and how it change things around the world was when I turned 20, being a sophomore. But I do hope that wasn't 2 late for me to learn teches, bcs when you done something that could help people around the world, promoting their life or social advance's the life I do want. I kown there might be so many "rules" exist and shouldn't try to break, I just want to burn all my engry for the faith I got with just basis stuffs I need, and painting artworks is just my main hobby.
Mainly works, designs, clips or practices paints\molds in these files are things I had done in 19~21, I had less of time mainly bcs I had lots of works to do in school(so I screwed a lot of those), thanks for your understanding, I will keep 'push' more degital works here and hope it won't break ur beautiful daylife. 
All works were done myself, No AI or 3D assisting LOL.
